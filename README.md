# Ballpit

This example is meant to showcase object generation and how they respond to their environment. It's much cleaner than a ballpit at your local Chuck-E-Cheese though.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates that I can create 'unlimited' objects and cause all of them to interact with the window edges.
